# Hotfix Module

## Purpose

The hotfix module provides emergency patch deployment capabilities for HOMESERVER systems. It serves as a safety net for critical fixes that need immediate deployment across all HOMESERVER installations when something goes wrong or when urgent patches are required.

## What It Does

- **Emergency File Replacement**: Rapidly deploy corrected files to any location in the HOMESERVER system
- **Atomic Operations**: Groups related fixes together so they succeed or fail as a unit
- **Safe Rollback**: Automatically reverts changes if fixes cause problems
- **Respect Customizations**: Won't break systems where users have made their own modifications
- **System Validation**: Verifies fixes work by testing system functionality after deployment

## Why It Matters

Even the most carefully designed systems sometimes need emergency fixes. HOMESERVER's hotfix module provides a controlled way to deploy critical patches when:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Immediate patches for newly discovered security issues
- **Critical Bugs**: Fixes for system-breaking bugs that can't wait for the next release
- **Configuration Errors**: Corrections to configuration files that prevent proper operation
- **Service Recovery**: Emergency repairs to restore failed services
- **Compatibility Issues**: Quick fixes for compatibility problems with new environments

## Integration with HOMESERVER

The hotfix module integrates with HOMESERVER's update system to provide controlled emergency patching. It respects the existing backup and rollback infrastructure while providing the flexibility to fix any component of the system when needed.

## Key Features

- **Pool-Based Deployment**: Groups related fixes together for atomic application
- **Intelligent Rollback**: Automatically undoes changes if the system can't function properly
- **Customer-Safe**: Preserves user modifications by reverting when conflicts are detected
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Creates full backups before making any changes
- **Validation Testing**: Runs system checks to ensure fixes work correctly
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed fixes don't break the overall system

This module serves as HOMESERVER's emergency response system - a tool you hope you'll never need, but when you do need it, it can save the day by rapidly deploying critical fixes across all deployed systems while maintaining safety and reliability.
